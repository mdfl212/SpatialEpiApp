#### Use app online: __[www.shinyappstore.com/a/SpatialEpiApp](https://shinyappstore.com/a/SpatialEpiApp)__

SpatialEpiApp is an application designed for visualizing spatial and spatio-temporal disease data, estimating disease risk, and identifying clusters. It integrates modules for disease risk estimation using Bayesian hierarchical models with INLA, cluster detection using scan statistics in SaTScan, and interactive visualizations including maps with zooming and panning, and filterable tables. The app also enables report generation summarizing the analyses conducted. SpatialEpiApp facilitates user interaction through R packages like Leaflet for maps, dygraphs, and more. This tool is particularly valuable for health surveillance researchers lacking advanced statistical and programming skills. With SpatialEpiApp, users can easily upload maps and data, and more. It serves as a comprehensive app for disease risk estimation, cluster detection, and interactive spatial and spatio-temporal visualization. Original publication: Paula Moraga.
